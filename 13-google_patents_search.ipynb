No. 12/716,780, filed Mar. 3, 2010, which claims the priority of United Kingdom Application Nos. 0903682.3, filed 4 Mar. 2009, and Ser. No. 0911178.2, filed 29 Jun. 2009, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.',\n",
       " 'The present invention relates to a fan assembly. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to a domestic fan, such as a tower fan, for creating a warm air current in a room, office or other domestic environment.',\n",
       " 'A conventional domestic fan typically includes a set of blades or vanes mounted for rotation about an axis, and drive apparatus for rotating the set of blades to generate an air flow. The movement and circulation of the air flow creates a ‘wind chill’ or breeze and, as a result, the user experiences a cooling effect as heat is dissipated through convection and evaporation.',\n",
       " 'Such fans are available in a variety of sizes and shapes. For example, a ceiling fan can be at least 1 m in diameter, and is usually mounted in a suspended manner from the ceiling to provide a downward flow of air to cool a room. On the other hand, desk fans are often around 30 cm in diameter, and are usually free standing and portable. Floor-standing tower fans generally comprise an elongate, vertically extending casing around 1 m high and housing one or more sets of rotary blades for generating an air flow. An oscillating mechanism may be employed to rotate the outlet from the tower fan so that the air flow is swept over a wide area of a room.',\n",
       " 'Fan heaters generally comprise a number of heating elements located either behind or in front of the rotary blades to enable a user to optionally heat the air flow generated by the rotating blades. The heating elements are commonly in the form of heat radiating coils or fins. A variable thermostat, or a number of predetermined output power settings, is usually provided to enable a user to control the temperature of the air flow emitted from the fan heater.',\n",
       " 'A disadvantage of this type of arrangement is that the air flow produced by the rotating blades of the fan heater is generally not uniform. This is due to variations across the blade surface or across the outward facing surface of the fan heater. The extent of these variations can vary from product to product and even from one individual fan heater to another. These variations result in the generation of a turbulent, or ‘choppy’, air flow which can be felt as a series of pulses of air and which can be uncomfortable for a user. A further disadvantage resulting from the turbulence of the air flow is that the heating effect of the fan heater can diminish rapidly with distance.',\n",
       " 'In a domestic environment it is desirable for appliances to be as small and compact as possible due to space restrictions. It is undesirable for parts of the appliance to project outwardly, or for a user to be able to touch any moving parts, such as the blades. Fan heaters tend to house the blades and the heat radiating coils within a moulded apertured casing to prevent user injury from contact with either the moving blades or the hot heat radiating coils, but such enclosed parts can be difficult to clean. Consequently, an amount of dust or other detritus can accumulate within the casing and on the heat radiating coils between uses of the fan heater. When the heat radiating coils are activated, the temperature of the outer surfaces of the coils can rise rapidly, particularly when the power output from the coils is relatively high, to a value in excess of 700° C. Consequently, some of the dust which has settled on the coils between uses of the fan heater can be burnt, resulting in the emission of an unpleasant smell from the fan heater for a period of time.',\n",
       " 'In a first aspect the present invention provides a bladeless fan assembly for creating an air current, the fan assembly comprising a device for creating an air flow and a nozzle comprising an interior passage for receiving the air flow and a mouth for emitting the air flow, the nozzle defining and extending about an opening through which air from outside the fan assembly is drawn by the air flow emitted from the mouth, the fan assembly further comprising an air heater.',\n",
       " 'Through use of a bladeless fan assembly an air current can be generated and a cooling effect created without the use of a bladed fan. In comparison to a bladed fan assembly, the bladeless fan assembly leads to a reduction in both moving parts and complexity. Furthermore, without the use of a bladed fan to project the air current from the fan assembly, a relatively uniform air current can be generated and guided into a room or towards a user. The heated air flow can travel efficiently out from the nozzle, losing less energy and velocity to turbulence than the air flow generated by prior art fan heaters. An advantage for a user is that the heated air flow can be experienced more rapidly at a distance of several metres from the fan assembly than when a prior art fan heater using a bladed fan is used to project the heated air flow from the fan assembly.',\n",
       " 'The term ‘bladeless’ is used to describe a fan assembly in which air flow is emitted or projected forward from the fan assembly without the use of moving blades. Consequently, a bladeless fan assembly can be considered to have an output area, or emission zone, absent moving blades from which the air flow is directed towards a user or into a room. The output area of the bladeless fan assembly may be supplied with a primary air flow generated by one of a variety of different sources, such as pumps, generators, motors or other fluid transfer devices, and which may include a rotating device such as a motor rotor and/or a bladed impeller for generating the air flow. The generated primary air flow can pass from the room space or other environment outside the fan assembly through the interior passage to the nozzle, and then back out to the room space through the mouth of the nozzle.',\n",
       " 'Hence, the description of a fan assembly as bladeless is not intended to extend to the description of the power source and components such as motors that are required for secondary fan functions. Examples of secondary fan functions can include lighting, adjustment and oscillation of the fan assembly.',\n",
       " 'The direction in which air is emitted from the mouth is preferably substantially at a right angle to the direction in which the air flow passes through at least part of the interior passage. Preferably, the air flow passes through at least part of the interior passage in a substantially vertical plane, and the air is emitted from the mouth in a substantially horizontal direction. The interior passage is preferably located towards the front of the nozzle, whereas the mouth is preferably located towards the rear of the nozzle and arranged to direct air towards the front of the nozzle and through the opening. Consequently, the mouth is preferably shaped so as substantially to reverse the flow direction of the air as it passes from the interior passage to an outlet of the mouth. The mouth is preferably substantially U-shaped in cross-section, and preferably narrows towards the outlet thereof.',\n",
       " 'The shape of the nozzle is not constrained by the requirement to include space for a bladed fan. Preferably, the nozzle surrounds the opening. For example, the nozzle may extend about the opening by a distance in the range from 50 to 250 cm. The nozzle may be an elongate, annular nozzle which preferably has a height in the range from 500 to 1000 mm, and a width in the range from 100 to 300 mm. Alternatively, the nozzle may be a generally circular annular nozzle which preferably has a height in the range from 50 to 400 mm. The interior passage is preferably annular, and is preferably shaped to divide the air flow into two air streams which flow in opposite directions around the opening.',\n",
       " 'The nozzle preferably comprises an inner casing section and an outer casing section which define the interior passage. Each section is preferably formed from a respective annular member, but each section may be provided by a plurality of members connected together or otherwise assembled to form that section. The outer casing section is preferably shaped so as to partially overlap the inner casing section to define at least one outlet of the mouth between overlapping portions of the external surface of the inner casing section and the internal surface of the outer casing section of the nozzle. Each outlet is preferably in the form of a slot, preferably having a width in the range from 0.5 to 5 mm. The mouth may comprise a plurality of such outlets spaced about the opening. For example, one or more sealing members may be located within the mouth to define a plurality of spaced apart outlets. Such outlets are preferably of substantially the same size. Where the nozzle is in the form of an elongate, annular nozzle, each outlet is preferably located along a respective elongate side of the inner periphery of the nozzle.',\n",
       " 'The nozzle may comprise a plurality of spacers for urging apart the overlapping portions of the inner casing section and the outer casing section of the nozzle. This can assist in maintaining a substantially uniform outlet width about the opening. The spacers are preferably evenly spaced along the outlet.',\n",
       " 'The nozzle may comprise a plurality of stationary guide vanes located within the interior passage and each for directing a portion of the air flow towards the mouth. The use of such guide vanes can assist in producing a substantially uniform distribution of the air flow through the mouth.',\n",
       " 'The nozzle may comprise a surface located adjacent the mouth and over which the mouth is arranged to direct the air flow emitted therefrom. Preferably, this surface is a curved surface, and more preferably is a Coanda surface. Preferably, the external surface of the inner casing section of the nozzle is shaped to define the Coanda surface. A Coanda surface is a known type of surface over which fluid flow exiting an output orifice close to the surface exhibits the Coanda effect. The fluid tends to flow over the surface closely, almost ‘clinging to’ or ‘hugging’ the surface. The Coanda effect is already a proven, well documented method of entrainment in which a primary air flow is directed over a Coanda surface. A description of the features of a Coanda surface, and the effect of fluid flow over a Coanda surface, can be found in articles such as Reba, Scientific American, Volume 214, June 1966 pages 84 to 92. Through use of a Coanda surface, an increased amount of air from outside the fan assembly is drawn through the opening by the air emitted from the mouth.',\n",
       " 'In a preferred embodiment an air flow is created through the nozzle of the fan assembly. In the following description this air flow will be referred to as the primary air flow. The primary air flow is emitted from the mouth of the nozzle and preferably passes over a Coanda surface. The primary air flow entrains air surrounding the mouth of the nozzle, which acts as an air amplifier to supply both the primary air flow and the entrained air to the user. The entrained air will be referred to here as a secondary air flow. The secondary air flow is drawn from the room space, region or external environment surrounding the mouth of the nozzle and, by displacement, from other regions around the fan assembly, and passes predominantly through the opening defined by the nozzle. The primary air flow directed over the Coanda surface combined with the entrained secondary air flow equates to a total air flow emitted or projected forward from the opening defined by the nozzle.',\n",
       " \"Preferably, the nozzle comprises a diffuser surface located downstream of the Coanda surface. The diffuser surface directs the air flow emitted towards a user's location while maintaining a smooth, even output, generating a suitable cooling effect without the user feeling a ‘choppy’ flow. Preferably, the external surface of the inner casing section of the nozzle is shaped to define the diffuser surface.\",\n",
       " 'Preferably the device for creating an air flow through the nozzle comprises an impeller driven by a motor. This can provide a fan assembly with efficient air flow generation. The means for creating an air flow preferably comprises a DC brushless motor and a mixed flow impeller. This can avoid frictional losses and carbon debris from the brushes used in a traditional brushed motor. Reducing carbon debris and emissions is advantageous in a clean or pollutant sensitive environment such as a hospital or around those with allergies. While induction motors, which are generally used in bladed fans, also have no brushes, a DC brushless motor can provide a much wider range of operating speeds than an induction motor.',\n",
       " 'The heater may be arranged to heat the primary air flow upstream of the mouth, with the secondary air flow being used to convey the heated primary air flow away from the fan assembly. Therefore, in a second aspect the present invention provides a bladeless fan assembly for creating an air current, the fan assembly comprising a device for creating an air flow and a nozzle comprising an interior passage for receiving the air flow and a mouth for emitting the air flow, the nozzle defining and extending about an opening through which air from outside the fan assembly is drawn by the air flow emitted from the mouth, the fan assembly further comprising a heater for heating the air flow upstream of the mouth.',\n",
       " 'Additionally, or alternatively, the heater may be arranged to heat the secondary air flow. In one embodiment, at least part of the heater is located downstream from the mouth to enable the heater to heat both the primary air flow and the secondary air flow.',\n",
       " 'Preferably, the nozzle comprises the heater. At least part of the heater may be located within the nozzle. The fan assembly may comprise a plurality of heaters arranged within the nozzle so as to extend about the opening. Where the nozzle defines a circular opening, the heaters preferably extend at least 270° about the opening and more preferably at least 300° about the opening. Where the nozzle defines an elongate opening, the heaters are preferably located on at least the opposite elongate sides of the opening.',\n",
       " 'In one embodiment the heater is arranged within the interior passage to heat the primary air flow upstream of the mouth. The heater may be connected to one of the internal surface of the inner casing section and the internal surface of the outer casing section so that at least part of the primary air flow passes over the heater before being emitted from the mouth. For example, the heater may comprise a plurality of thin-film heaters connected to one, or both, of these internal surfaces.',\n",
       " 'Alternatively, the heater may be located between the internal surfaces so that substantially all of the primary air flow passes through the heater before being emitted from the mouth. For example, the heater may comprise a porous heater located within the interior passage so that the primary air flow passes through pores in the heater before being emitted from the mouth. The porous heater may be formed from ceramic material, preferably a PTC (positive temperature coefficient) ceramic heater which is capable of rapidly heating the air flow upon activation. The heater is preferably configured to prevent the temperature of the heater from rising above 200° C. so that no “burnt dust” odours are emitted from the fan assembly.',\n",
       " 'The ceramic material may be optionally coated in metallic or other electrically conductive material to facilitate connection of the heater to a controller within the fan assembly for activating the heater. Alternatively, at least one non-porous heater may be mounted within a metallic frame located within the interior passage and which is connected to the controller. The metallic frame serves to provide a greater surface area and hence better heat transfer, while also providing a means of electrical connection to the heater.',\n",
       " 'The inner casing section and the outer casing section of the nozzle may be formed from plastics material or other material having a relatively low thermal conductivity (less than 1 Wm−1K−1), to prevent the external surfaces of the nozzle from becoming excessively hot during use of the fan assembly. However, the inner casing section may be formed from material having a higher thermal conductivity than the outer casing section so that the inner casing section becomes heated by the heater. This can allow heat to be transferred from the internal surface of the inner casing section—located upstream of the mouth—to the primary air flow passing through the interior passage, and from the external surface of the inner casing section—located downstream of the mouth—to the primary and secondary air flows passing through the opening.',\n",
       " 'As an alternative to locating the heater within at least part of the nozzle, at least part of the heater may be located within a casing housing the device for creating an air flow, or within another part of the fan assembly through which the air flow passes. Therefore, in a third aspect the present invention provides a bladeless fan assembly for creating an air current, the fan assembly comprising a device for creating an air flow and a nozzle comprising an interior passage for receiving the air flow and a mouth for emitting the air flow, the nozzle defining and extending about an opening through which air from outside the fan assembly is drawn by the air flow emitted from the mouth, the fan assembly further comprising a porous heater through which the air flow passes.',\n",
       " 'As another example, the fan assembly may comprise a plurality of heaters located within the interior passage, and a plurality of heat radiating fins connected to the heaters and extending at least partially across the interior passage to transfer heat to the primary air flow. Two sets of such fins may be connected to each heater, with each set of fins extending from the heater towards a respective one of the internal surface of the inner casing section and the internal surface of the outer casing section of the nozzle.',\n",
       " 'Alternatively, the heater may be otherwise located within the nozzle so as to be in thermal contact with the interior passage to heat the air flow upstream from the mouth.',\n",
       " 'For example, the heater may be located within the inner casing section of the nozzle, with at least the internal surface of the inner casing section being formed from thermally conductive material to convey heat from the heater to the primary air flow passing through the interior passage. For example, the inner casing section may be formed from material having a thermal conductivity greater than 10 Wm−1K−1, and preferably from a metallic material such as aluminium or an aluminium alloy.',\n",
       " 'The fan assembly may comprise a plurality of heaters located within the inner casing section of the housing. For example, the fan assembly may comprise a plurality of cartridge heaters located between the internal surface and the external surface of the inner casing section. Where the nozzle is in the form of an elongate, annular nozzle, at least one heater may be located along each opposing elongate surface of the nozzle. For example, the fan assembly may comprise a plurality of sets of cartridge heaters, with each set of cartridge heaters being located along a respective side of the nozzle. Each set of cartridge heaters may comprise two or more cartridge heaters.',\n",
       " 'The heaters may be located between an inner portion and an outer portion of the inner casing section of the nozzle. At least the outer portion of the inner casing section of the nozzle, and preferably both the inner portion and the outer portion of the inner casing section of the nozzle, is preferably formed from material having a higher thermal conductivity than the outer casing section of the nozzle (preferably greater than 10 Wm−1K−1), and preferably from a metallic material such as aluminium or an aluminium alloy. The use of a material such as aluminium can assist in reducing the thermal load of the heating means, and thereby increase both the rate at which the temperature of the heating means increases upon activation and the rate at which the air is heated.',\n",
       " 'Such a portion of the inner casing section may be considered to form part of the heater. Consequently, the heater may partially define the interior passage of the nozzle. The heater may comprise one or both of the Coanda surface and the diffuser surface.',\n",
       " 'The heaters may be selectively activated by the user, either individually or in pre-defined combinations, to vary the temperature of the air current emitted from the nozzle.',\n",
       " 'The heater may protrude at least partially across the opening. In one embodiment, the heater comprises a plurality of heat radiating fins extending at least partially across the opening. This can assist in increasing the rate at which heat is transferred from the heater to the air passing through the opening. Where the nozzle is in the form of an elongate, annular nozzle, a stack of heat radiating fins may be located along each of the opposing elongate surfaces of the nozzle. Any dust or other detritus which may have settled on the upper surfaces of the heat radiating fins between successive uses of the fan assembly can be rapidly blown from those surfaces by the air flow drawn through the opening when the fan assembly is switched on. During use, an external surface temperature of the heater is preferably in the range from 40 to 70° C., preferably no more than around 50° C., so that user injury from accidental contact with the heat radiating fins or other external surface of the heater, and the “burning” of any dust remaining on the external surfaces of the heater, can be avoided.',\n",
       " 'The fan assembly may be desk or floor standing, or wall or ceiling mountable.',\n",

In this example, the bladeless fan assembly is in the form of a domestic tower fan 10 comprising a base 12 and a nozzle 14 mounted on and supported by the base 12. The base 12 comprises a substantially cylindrical outer casing 16 mounted optionally on a disc-shaped base plate 18. The outer casing 16 comprises a plurality of air inlets 20 in the form of apertures formed in the outer casing 16 and through which a primary air flow is drawn into the base 12 from the external environment.

       " 'The even distribution of the primary air flow along the mouth 26 of the nozzle 14 ensures that the air flow passes evenly over the diffuser surface 30. The diffuser surface 30 causes the mean speed of the air flow to be reduced by moving the air flow through a region of controlled expansion. The relatively shallow angle of the diffuser surface 30 to the central axis X of the opening 24 allows the expansion of the air flow to occur gradually. A harsh or rapid divergence would otherwise cause the air flow to become disrupted, generating vortices in the expansion region. Such vortices can lead to an increase in turbulence and associated noise in the air flow, which can be undesirable, particularly in a domestic product such as a fan. In the absence of the guide vanes 120 most of the primary air flow would tend to leave the fan 10 through the upper part of the mouth 26, and to leave the mouth 26 upwardly at an acute angle to the central axis of the opening 24. As a result there would be an uneven distribution of air within the air current generated by the fan 10.

In this example, the nozzle 300 comprises a plurality of heaters, indicated generally at 330, located within the interior passage 320 of the nozzle 300 and through which the primary air flow passes as it flows through the nozzle 300. As illustrated in FIG. 23, the heaters 330 are preferably arranged in an array which extends about the opening 302, and is preferably located in a plane extending orthogonal to the axis X of the nozzle 300. The array preferably extends at least 270° about the axis X, more preferably at least 315° about the axis X. In this example, the array of heaters 330 extends around 320° about the axis, with each end of the array terminating at or around a respective side of the aperture in the base 326 of the outer casing section 314. The array of heaters 330 is preferably arranged towards the rear of the interior passage 320 so that substantially all of the primary air flow passes through the array of heaters 330 before entering the mouth 304, and less heat is lost to the plastic parts of the nozzle 300.',\n",
       " 'The array of heaters 330 may be provided by a plurality of ceramic heaters arranged side-by-side within the interior passage 320. The heaters 330 are preferably formed from porous, positive temperature coefficient (PTC) ceramic material, and may be located within respective apertures formed in an arcuate metallic frame which is located within, for example, the outer casing section 314 before the inner casing section 316 is attached thereto. Power leads extending from the frame may extend through the base 326 of the outer casing section 314 and terminate in connectors which mate with co-operating connectors located on the upper casing section 80 of the base 12 when the nozzle 300 is connected to the base 12. These co-operating connectors may be connected to power leads extending within the base 12 to the controller 44. At least one additional user operable button or dial may be provided on the lower casing section 40 of the base 12 to enable a user to activate the array of heaters 330. During use the maximum temperature of the heaters 330 is around 200° C.',\n",
       " 'In use, the operation of the fan assembly 10 with the nozzle 300 is much the same as the operation of the fan assembly with the nozzle 200. When the user has depressed the additional button on the base 12, or manipulated the additional dial, the controller 44 activates the array of heaters 330. The heat generated by the array of heaters 330 is transferred by convection to the primary air flow passing through the interior passage 320 so that a heated primary air flow is emitted from the mouth 304 of the nozzle 300. The heated primary air flow entrains air from the room space, region or external environment surrounding the mouth 304 of the nozzle 300 as it passes over the Coanda surface 306 and through the opening 302 defined by the nozzle 300, resulting in an overall air flow projected forward from the fan assembly 10 which has a lower temperature than the primary air flow emitted from the mouth 304, but a higher temperature than the air entrained from the external environment. Consequently, a current of warm air is emitted from the fan assembly. As with the current of warm air generated by the nozzle 200, this current of warm air can travel efficiently out from the nozzle 300, losing less energy and velocity to turbulence than the air flow generated by prior art fan heaters.',\n",
